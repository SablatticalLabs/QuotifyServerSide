Remember a few weeks ago, when you were with <%=@quote.quotifier.name%> and <%=@quote.speaker.name%>?

Well, apparently, <%=@quote.speaker.name%> said something quote-worthy.

Memory a little hazy?   Well, you're in luck, because <%= @quote.quotifier.name %> quotified it, & this quote was just unlocked -- So saddle up, and go to http://quotify.it/<%=@quote_witness.witness_quote_id%> to check it out!

				<h4>Lior Sabag</h4>
				<a href="http://www.twitter.com/lior_sabag">@lior_sabag</a>
				<p>Heralding from Israel (the land of milk, honey, and high tech industry) Lior is the resident fixer of all things and designated maker of exquisite falafel.  He implemented the Quotify.it mobile app from the ground up while running a marathon in the Swiss Alps and solving a Rubik's cube with his free hand.</p>

				<h4>Ninna Amora</h4>
				<a href="http://www.twitter.com/NinnaAmora">@NinnaAmora</a>
				<p>Since gradating with a degree in 18th century Italian sculpture, Ninna has spent 6 years in the marketing and instructional video world, and amazingly, still smiles every once in a while. The things she does led directly to you finding this page. So thank you, Ninna. And - you're welcome. </p>

				<h4>Kevin Owocki</h4>
				<a href="http://www.twitter.com/owocki">@owocki</a>
				<p>When he's not hovering over the Indian SubContinent with his cupid-like bow and arrow, Kevin is a lean, mean, programming machine.  The idea for Quotify.it hit him like a thunderbolt in his sleep one night, he ran to his computer in a frenzy, and the rest - is history.</p>

				<h4>Matthew Tyler</h4>
				<a href="http://www.matthewtyler.com">www.matthewtyler.com</a>
				<p>Before Matt joined the team, Quotify.it was an amazingly well oiled machine - that looked like <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/jjdorsey57/3655440977/lightbox/'>this</a>.  He turned it into <a href='http://www.google.com/imgres?hl=en&sa=X&biw=1360&bih=816&tbm=isch&prmd=imvnso&tbnid=c0baG7F1bPx11M:&imgrefurl=http://www.isteroids.com/bodybuilding/arnold_schwarzenegger_pictures.html&docid=gJR84CSx0-AKJM&imgurl=http://www.isteroids.com/bodybuilding/images/arnold_schwarzenegger4.jpg&w=400&h=705&ei=K3rqT_etDurC6gHa_ZG2BQ&zoom=1&iact=rc&dur=357&sig=107165721203529922323&page=2&tbnh=143&tbnw=73&start=33&ndsp=39&ved=1t:429,r:5,s:33,i:262&tx=42&ty=74'>this</a>. Enough said.</p>

				<img src="Assets/Images/team/silhouettes/evan.png"/>
				<h4>Evan Buxbaum</h4>
				<a href="http://www.evanbuxbaum.com/">www.evanbuxbaum.com</a>
				<p>Evan grew up in New York, attended Swarthmore College, and after co-founding Quotify.it, was swiftly demoted to copy-writer.  He also scans documents and makes a mean cafe Americano.  But he prefers a nice chamomile tea, if anyone's asking.</p>

			<li>
				<img src="Assets/Images/team/silhouettes/max.png"/>
				<h4>Max Rosenblatt</h4>
				<a href="http://www.twitter.com/MaxRosenblatt">@MaxRosenblatt</a>
				<p>Yes he's from Boston, and yes he's probably a Patriot's fan, but the man is such a brilliant developer, we had to forgive him.  He surely likes nothing more than curling up with a creamy lobster bisque on a cold winter's night and watching a Mark Wahlberg flick, but the important things is what he wakes up and builds the next morning - an amazing app.</p>

				<img src="Assets/Images/team/silhouettes/rob.png"/>
				<h4>Rob Goretsky</h4>
				<a href="http://www.twitter.com/robg760">@robg760</a>
				<p>Rob grew up in Pasadena and has spent his time since then learning how to program everything from the DVR to a seven course tasting menu, with wine parring. When he's not working, he says so many quotable things he could almost crash the server he configured himself.  Almost.</p>

				<p>She can draw you.  As a small icon.  Or even a big one.  And if you sign up, maybe she will!</p>
